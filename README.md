# Getting started

## Introduction
    The codebase is split into server (backend/express) and client (frontend/react).
    Each project has its own npm packages and needs to run separately.

## Prerequisite
    Have the latest version of node installed (node 18). You may be able to get away
    with a slightly lower version but for sure anything lower than v16.9 will not
    work due to missing features.

    For image uploading, have a jpeg or png image that's smaller than 5MB.

## Starting the Backend Express Server 
    `cd server`
    `npm install`
    `npm start`

## Starting the Frontend React Client (Development Mode)
    `cd client`
    `npm install`
    `npm start`

### MAKE SURE BOTH APPS ARE RUNNING

## Opening the Site
    if the React client did not open a new tab, enter http://127.0.0.1:3000
    in a browser
